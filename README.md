# SDF Instant-NGP on HashNeRF

The project aims to integrate signed distance functions (SDF), following the approach usedin Instant-NGP, into the HashNeRF framework.

This project is ongoing.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git

2. Stanford 3D Scanning Dataset:
   ```bash

## Citation

SDF method is based on NVIDIA's Instant-NGP enlightening work

    ```bash
    @article{mueller2022instant,
    title = {Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding},
    author = {Thomas M\"uller and Alex Evans and Christoph Schied and Alexander Keller},
    journal = {arXiv:2201.05989},
    year = {2022},

}

The whole project was inspired by Yash's amazing work on HashNeRF
